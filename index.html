    <h1>Genuine Greens</h1>
    <p>
        Throughout my research on the marijuana delivery service
        in New York City, I came across a common problem that both
        the delivery service companies and the customers face. <b></b>

            Many customers are very unfamilar with who is running the services,
            who is deliverying to them and coming inside their home? More importantly,
            how clean is the product?

    <p>
        During my research presentation, it became clear that many people
        were unfamilar with how the marijuana service works. One of the slides
        contained a "how it works" image which ended up misleading and made the 
        delivery look for like an uber-like operated app. I thought well, there
        should be one! Which ulitmately led me to decide on my Genuine Greens
        what if concept.

    <h2>
    <em>Learning Outcome</em>
</h2>
   <p> My poster shows a delivery service made to please both the consumer and the
    driver based on information found during my research. The most common 
    misconception of a marijuana delivery service is the older view
    that a sketchy dealer comes by your house with a baggie of marijuana. My project
    aims to represents a professional, idealistic way of respresenting research in the form
    of a business advertisment.
    In short, Genuine Greens is an informational graphic disguised as a 
    "what if" business based on the findings from my research.
